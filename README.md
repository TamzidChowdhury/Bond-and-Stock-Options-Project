# Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project

This was a group project, done as a part of my Computational Finance class. The project had Four milestones. 

1) The first milestone was to create a [Bond Calculator](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/bond_calculator.py). In this bond calculator, we used Python to implement bond related calculations such as The Clean Price, The Accrual Interest, The Macaulay Duration, The Modified Duration etc. 
2) The second milestone had three parts: 
  a) The first task was to use Python to define [Fundamental Analysis techniques](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/stock.py) such as Daily Historical Price over a certain period, Total Debt, Free Cashflow, Cash and Cash Equivalent value of a company etc. 
  b) The second task was defining some of the [Technical Analysis Techniques](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/TA.py) used in the stock market. Some of the techniques we defined are Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Relative Strength Index(RSI), VWAP etc.
  c) The last task was calculating the fair value of a company using the [Discounted Cash Flow Model](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/DCF_model.py).
3) The third milestone was to implement the [Run Analysis](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/run_analysis.py) notebook, which takes in an [input file](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/StockUniverse.csv) with some stock ticker symbols and produces information about the company such as Symbol, EPS Next 5Y in percent, DCF Value, Current Price, Sector, Total Assets, Total Debt, Free Cash Flow, SMA over different time periods etc. And outputs them into the [output file](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/StockUniverseOutput.csv). 
4) The finel milestone was to select a stock and use all the technical and fundamental analysis we defined in the previous milestones to decided whether to [sell or buy](https://github.com/TamzidChowdhury/Bond-and-Stock-Options-Project/blob/main/CF_Fall21_summary_VZ_Analysis.pdf) the stock at a specific date.
